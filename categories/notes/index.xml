Introduction Proof of Stake is a novel consensus algorithm that validates blocks mainly according to a validator’s economic stake in the network rather than the hash power. Regarded as the next generation mainstream consensus mechanism of blockchain technology, it has significant advantages including energy saving, reduced risk of centralization and security.
However, in the early discussion of PoS protocol, it is seem to be more vulnerable due to the fact that it is not aware of anything in reality.</description>

Introduction Long Range Attack is an attack behavior that attacker make a conflict point on a historic block in order to construct a private chain and overtake the legal main chain.
This attack is seem to be only appeared in Proof of Stake-based blockchain theoretically due to the weak subjectivity and costless simulation of such consensus algorithm.
Steps to launching The actual steps to lauch Long Range Attack is as follow:</description>

Introduction As a decentralized digital currency system, the network architecture of Ethereum is very important since the synchronization of data and the update of nodes’ status both depend on the connection mechanism between nodes. Peer to Peer(P2P) protocol is used as a communication link for Ethereum and has been developed in various aspects according to the transmission of data(e.g. blocks, transaction and hash value) and message in the network, which can be divided into three layers.</description>

What is Proof of Stake Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus algorithms for public blockchains that depend on a validator&amp;rsquo;s economic stake in the network and it is an alternative consensus mechanism to blockchain systems. Instead of consuming largely computational resource in PoW, PoS just need a little computational power to resolve a simple puzzel. Therefore, the majority of problems with PoS protocols arise from the fact that there is nothing physical &amp;ldquo;anchoring&amp;rdquo; in real-world.</description>
